automatic fire-fighting robot that uses IoT to detect and extinguish fires autonomously. Equipped with flame sensors, gas/smoke sensors, and an Arduino Uno microcontroller, the robot navigates its environment, detects fire hazards, and takes appropriate action to mitigate them. It also features a GSM module for sending SMS and call alerts to designated phone numbers in case of a fire, making it ideal for industrial, residential, and forest fire prevention applications.
